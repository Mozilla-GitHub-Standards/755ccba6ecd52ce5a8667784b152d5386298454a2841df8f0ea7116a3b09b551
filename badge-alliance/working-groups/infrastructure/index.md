This group connected in 2014 to help develop, maintain, and evolve the technical underpinning that supports Open Badges systems. 

<h2 class="title title-content" id="resources">Infrastructure Resources:</h2>

The [Infrastructure mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/ba-obi) has been archived. Please join us at the [Open Badges community space](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openbadges). 

<h2 class="title title-content" id="cycle-1">1st Cycle Infrastructure Working Group Deliverables</h2>

* Formed Technology Advisory Council comprised of thought leaders in and out of the Open Badges world to help them think through critical pieces of the existing Open Badges technology and synthesize those conversations in order to plan near- and long-term goals.
* Kicked off first meeting, spanning two days at MIT Media Lab on July 8, 2014.
* Drafted an Open Badges Infrastructure strategy

One of the goals of the first tech council meeting was to plan how the Badge Alliance could guide the development of the Open Badges technical infrastructure. The council agreed on a framework to determine where the BA could be effective at direct action, and where the BA needed to play a more advisory role. The Open Badges infrastructure was described as three layers:
* The Open Badges Standard
* Libraries that are built on top of the standard + reference implementations and prototypes
* Hosted services that rely on the standard and libraries


The council advised that the Badge Alliance should be responsible for the Open Badges Standard (layer 1) and play a large role in building and maintaining libraries and prototypes (layer 2), but should largely stay out of hosting services (layer 3). Like all frameworks, the layer model should be considered a loose guide. Thereâ€™s instances in all three layers where the framework can't be considered a hard fast rule. Examples include working with a 3rd party standards body to maintain the Open Badges Standard, the Badge Alliance building prototype services to demonstrate utility in the market, and open source developers building libraries on top of the standard.
