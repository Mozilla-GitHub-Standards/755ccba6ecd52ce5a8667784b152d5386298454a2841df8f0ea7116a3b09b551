In 2014 and 2015, the Workforce Working Group explored ways to link badges to jobs, internships, career advancement, and other opportunities within the workforce. Members considered the importance of “soft skills” like leadership, as well as the value of more traditional “hard skills” such as technical competency. The group worked to find and grow the potential of Open Badges across academia, industry, government, and society, adding professional capital to the Open Badges movement.
