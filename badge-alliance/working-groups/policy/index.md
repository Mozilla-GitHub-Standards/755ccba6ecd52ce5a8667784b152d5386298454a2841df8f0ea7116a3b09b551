The Policy Working Group was formed in 2014 to track and review government policies that influenced or affected the Open Badges ecology, with a special focus on U.S. federal policies. Members provided guidance and advice on possible research, made policy recommendations regarding the development of the Open Badges ecosystem, wrote public comments to requests, and encouraged advocacy. The group built a series of informational documents to explain the role of policy in Open Badges and to survey the landscape of policies.
