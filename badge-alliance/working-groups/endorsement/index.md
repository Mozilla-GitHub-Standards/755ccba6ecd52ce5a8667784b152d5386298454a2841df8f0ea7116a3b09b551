The Endorsement Working Group, which convened in 2014, focused on how to build functionality and practice around 3rd party endorsement of Open Badges. Their work played a crucial role in expanding the ecosystem, connecting key stakeholders to badges, and adding value to badges.

[Badge Endorsement: Getting Started](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VVf19d72KmGMh1ywrLe7HCKEOqGSI0WjvwfGN_8Q2M4/edit?usp=sharing) (framework paper)

The Endorsement Working Group developed the conceptual and practical framework for the endorsement of Open Badges. Endorsement is a game changer for how badges are used, understood, and trusted, because it allows 3rd party organizations to publicly indicate which badges are aligned with their values—those that are the most meaningful and useful to them. It adds a new metadata component to the Open Badges Specification and defines the structure for rich, well-defined endorsement information and criteria such as alignment with standards, uses for the badge in the context of the endorsing organization, description of evidence of learning, and assessment techniques the organization values. This group advanced the short-  and long-term evolution of Open Badges endorsement.
<h2 class="title title-content" id="cycle-1">1st Cycle Goals</h2>
The first cycle began in April 2014 and concluded in September 2014. Initial goals included:

* Example cases and practical implementation goals and deliverables:
   * Use personas from the overarching deliverables to discuss use cases and requirements, both in support of development of technical infrastructure and to make the processes involved more concrete and easy to visualize
   * Develop overarching models for generating endorsements such as:
      * endorser and the endorsee (badge Issuer) both agree to include information about the endorsement in badge metadata
      * ability to “push” an endorsement to an Issuer
      * outside endorsement that isn’t acknowledged by the Issuer
* Develop overarching models for consuming endorsements such as:
   * how endorsements are discovered and understood by badge seekers/learners
   * how endorsements are understood by badge Consumers such as employers and educators
* Support development of technical infrastructure (OBI)
* Provide context for technical implementation and experimentation with how endorsement will work
* Gather feedback
