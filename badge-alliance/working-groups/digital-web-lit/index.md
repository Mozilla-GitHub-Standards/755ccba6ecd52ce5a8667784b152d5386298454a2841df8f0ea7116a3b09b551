In 2014 and 2015, this group encouraged the growth of a shared badge system for promoting and recognizing important digital skills. The members focused on developing and connecting badge systems for 21st-century digital skills and web literacies that often aren’t captured by traditional credentials or formal degrees. This working group, in conjunction with the Mozilla community, helped define the Web Literacy Map.
