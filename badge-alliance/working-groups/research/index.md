This group built a research base around badges and badge system design thinking. The members met in 2014 and 2015 to explore and expand research on Open Badges, filtering existing research into lay terms.

The Research Working Group ramped up quickly as one of the initial set of Badge Alliance working groups. This group designed a landscape survey with the aim of identifying common research needs among different badge-interested parties. The survey was conducted through the University of Michigan, with working group contributor Steve Lonn acting as principal investigator.

* Begin developing a research agenda for Open Badges
* Build spaces to collaborate and communicate as badge researchers
* Collect and organize existing research relevant to badges, and make it available to the community.

The Research Working Group established a research base that reported on a variety of Open Badges aspects. This group of academic researchers, design researchers, badge system designers, consultants, and other badge-interested parties worked to corral the wide range of research into a few accessible locations, filtered existing research into lay terms, and devised tools to aid Open Badges research, consideration, and examination. Covering the entire realm of the Open Badges ecosystem, this group actively worked to inform the public with meaningful information about Open Badges.
